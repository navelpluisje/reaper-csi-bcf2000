> ### Note
>
> The top and bottom buttons are custom actions and are created to the way I work with Reaper.
> They function like demonstrated in this [ReaperBlog Video](https://reaperblog.net/2015/11/video-follow-track-visibility-with-the-bcf2000/)
> The actual action files are added in this project, but you can easily assign other actions to these buttons.
>
> More information about zone files and assinging actions can be found at the [CSI wiki](https://github.com/malcolmgroves/reaper_csi/wiki/Zones)
